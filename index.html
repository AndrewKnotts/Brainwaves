    <p style="color:powderblue;">The following screen is a visual representation of your current brain activity.</p>
    <p style="color:powderblue;">That's right. This website is directly connected to your brain. 
      </p>
    <p style="color:powderblue;">Shocking, I know. But don't let it bother you. As long as the lines are straight you should be fine.

     <p style="color:powderblue;">Note: this image is only being used because it is already online on Callie's Linkedn so she wont get mad at me for putting up pictures of her.

      <p style="color:powderblue;">ALSO, I worked for ages on this stupid thing even though I was mostly just watching tutorials but isnt it cool? It's a visual representation of Perlin noise. the whole screen is a grid with vectors mapped to a certain Perlin noise, and then particles are dropped on it leaving a trail. Refresh it a few times cause it changes every time!
